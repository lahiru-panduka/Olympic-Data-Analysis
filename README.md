# Exploring 120 Years of Olympic History

This repository delves into an analysis of the modern Olympic Games, spanning 120 years from 1896 to 2016.

## Project Description

I aim to explore this rich dataset through the lens of exploratory data analysis (EDA), seeking to uncover insights and trends in various aspects of the Olympics. This includes:

- Participation: How has athlete and nation participation evolved over time?
- Performance: Are there trends in medal distribution across different countries and sports?
- Gender: How has gender representation changed in the Olympics over the years?

## Data

Data source: This project utilizes the publicly available dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/120-years-of-olympic-history by "heesoo37".
Description: The dataset contains approximately 271,116 rows, each representing an individual athlete participating in a specific event. It includes information on the athlete (name, gender, age, etc.), event details (sport, game year and city), and their medal achievement (if any).

## Analysis

Tools and libraries: The analysis will be conducted using Python, primarily leveraging libraries like pandas for data manipulation and visualization libraries like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly for creating insightful charts and graphs.

- Prerequisites: Python 3.x with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries installed.
- Instructions:
  - Clone this repository.
  - Install the required libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
  - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
  - Run the analysis script: python main.py (Replace "main.py" with the actual script name).
This script will perform cleaning and analysis steps, generating visualizations saved in the figures folder.
